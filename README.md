# IndicPhotoOCR Dataset & Evaluation Contribution

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains a benchmark dataset of 71 natural scene images with text in various Indic scripts (e.g., shop signs, banners, street boards) annotated with polygons and transcriptions. It is intended to test and evaluate the [IndicPhotoOCR](https://github.com/Bhashini-IITJ/IndicPhotoOCR) system. This repo also includes scripts and output results.

## 🔧 Installation

To run the scripts and evaluate on your machine:


## Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepjyotiRoy01/IndicPhotoOCR.git
cd IndicPhotoOCR
```
## Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n indicphotoocr python=3.10 -y
conda activate indicphotoocr
```
## Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🖼️ Usage
➤ Run OCR on a single image
```bash
python Scripts/Single_ImageOCR.py
```
➤ Run OCR on a folder of images
```bash
python Scripts/Multiple_ImageOCR.py
```
➤ Run detection only (without recognition)
```bash
python Scripts/Detection.py
```
Make sure to update image paths or folder paths inside the scripts as needed.

📦 Output Format
```json
JSON (example):
{
  "image": "IMG_41.jpg",
  "text": "ইলেকট্রিক",
  "bbox": [[1044, 609],
          [1557, 609],
          [1557, 903],
          [1044, 903]],
  "script": "Bengali"
}
```
## CSV (example):
| image       | text     | bbox                         | language  |
|-------------|----------|------------------------------|-----------|
|IMG_41.jpg   |	ইলেকট্রিক |	[[1044, 609],,,[1044, 903]]	| Bengali   |
